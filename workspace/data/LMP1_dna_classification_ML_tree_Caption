Figure. Molecular Phylogenetic analysis by Maximum Likelihood method
The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Jukes-Cantor model [1]. The tree with the highest log likelihood (-4232.42) is shown. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 107 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. All positions with less than 10% site coverage were eliminated. That is, fewer than 90% alignment gaps, missing data, and ambiguous bases were allowed at any position. There were a total of 1161 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7 [2].
