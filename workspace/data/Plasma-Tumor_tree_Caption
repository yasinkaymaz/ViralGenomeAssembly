Figure. Evolutionary relationships of taxa
The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [1]. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 0.02306652 is shown. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Jukes-Cantor method [2] and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. The analysis involved 14 nucleotide sequences. All positions with less than 100% site coverage were eliminated. That is, fewer than 0% alignment gaps, missing data, and ambiguous bases were allowed at any position. There were a total of 109868 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7 [3].
